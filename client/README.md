# Client

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Proxy to the API

In order to get real data from the API: Copy the content from `proxy.conf.template.json` into a new `proxy.conf.json` file and adapt it to your needs. With `yarn start:dev` you then can use it for local development.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Running end-to-end tests

At this moment E2E-Tests are not set up yet. Later Cypress will be used instead of Protractor.
