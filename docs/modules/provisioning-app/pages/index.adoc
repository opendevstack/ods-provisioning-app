= Provisioning Application

This application creates new OpenDevStack projects. It is the central entrypoint to get started with a new project / or provision new components based on xref:quickstarters:index.adoc[quickstarters].
It delegates the tasks to create / update resources to several services such as Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket and Jenkins.


== Creating a new project

Any user with admin privileges can create new ODS projects through the provisioning application.

A new ODS project typically consists of:

* a Jira Project (name based on project `<project-key>`)
* a Confluence Space (name based on project `<project-key>`)
* a Bitbucket project (name based on project `<project-key>`)
* two Openshift projects named `<project-key>-dev` and `<project-key>-test`, which are used to run your application. Further, a Jenkins deployment will be created in the `<project-key>-cd` project to allow each ODS project full freedom of build management. This deployment is based on a common Jenkins image provided by the central ODS namespace.

== Creating a new component within a project (using a quickstarter)

Open the web GUI of the provisioning app (ask your ODS administrator for the URL). Select your project, then choose a quickstarter. If no framework fits your needs, choose the xref:quickstarters:docker-plain.adoc[docker-plain quickstarter], and adjust the repository afterwards as required.

After provisioning the quickstarter, youâ€™ll have a new repository in your Bitbucket project with the boilerplate of the component. This repository has a webhook configured which will start a new Jenkins job each time a new commit is pushed. This means the new component will immediately be built and deployed into your `<project-key>-dev` project.

== FAQ

. Why are three OpenShift projects created when I provision a new project? +
The `<project-key>-dev` and `<project-key>-test` namespaces are **runtime** namespaces. Depending on which branch you merge / commit your code into, images will be built & deployed in one of the two (further information on how this is done - can be found in the xref:jenkins-shared-library:component-pipeline.adoc[Component Pipeline] +
In contrast to this, the `<project-key>-cd` namespace hosts a project-specific instance of xref:jenkins:master.adoc[Jenkins Master] and xref:jenkins:webhook-proxy.adoc[Webhook Proxy]. When a build is triggered, builder pods (= deployments of xref:jenkins:slave-base.adoc[Jenkins slaves]) are created in this project. +
This was a cautious design choice to give a project team as much power as possible when it comes to configuration of Jenkins.
