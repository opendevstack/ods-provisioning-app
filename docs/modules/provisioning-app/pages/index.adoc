= Provisioning Application

toc::[]

This application creates new OpenDevStack projects. It is the central entrypoint to get started with a new project / or provision new components based on xref:quickstarters:index.adoc[quickstarters].
It delegates the tasks to create / update resources to several services such as Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket and Jenkins.

== Basic idea & usage

. An admin creates new ODS project. This in turn creates:
 ** a Jira Project (name based on project `key`)
 ** a Confluence Space (name based on project `key`)
 ** if OpenShift was selected - a Bitbucket Project (name based on project `key`). Within this project two default repositories are created: `<project-key>-oc-config-artifacts` for all OpenShift YAML resources used during export/import as well as `<project-key>-design<project>` for any design artifacts (e.g. sketches)
 ** if OpenShift was selected - the required Openshift projects named `<project-key>-dev`, `<project-key>-test` and `<project-key>-cd`. Internally those are created and configured using a Jenkins pipeline.
. A normal user creates new components by provisioning quickstarters. This can be done by picking the project to modify in the UI and then selecting the desired quickstarter. This creates:
 ** a Bitbucket repository within the chosen project named `<project-key>-<component-name>`. This repository has a webhook configured which will start a new Jenkins job each time a new commit is pushed.
 ** OpenShift resources based on the chosen xref:quickstarters:index.adoc[quickstarter]

== FAQ

. Why are three OpenShift projects created when I provision a new project? +
The `<project-key>-dev` and `<project-key>-test` namespaces are **runtime** namespaces. Depending on which branch you merge / commit your code into, images will be built & deployed in one of the two (further information on how this is done - can be found in the xref:jenkins-shared-library:component-pipeline.adoc[Component Pipeline] +
In contrast to this, the `<project-key>-cd` namespace hosts a project-specific instance of xref:jenkins:master.adoc[Jenkins Master] and xref:jenkins:webhook-proxy.adoc[Webhook Proxy]. When a build is triggered, builder pods (= deployments of xref:jenkins:slave-base.adoc[Jenkins slaves]) are created in this project. +
This was a cautious design choice to give a project team as much power as possible when it comes to configuration of Jenkins.
