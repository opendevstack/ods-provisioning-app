toc::[]

This application creates new OpenDevStack digital projects. It is the central entrypoint to get started with a new project / or provision new components based on https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-project-quickstarters[quickstarters].
It delegates the tasks to create / update resources to several services such as jira, confluence, bitbucket and rundeck.

== Basic idea & usage

. An admin (user in a group defined in property `idmanager.group.opendevstack-administrators`) creates new ODS project. This in turn creates
 ** a Jira Project (name based on project `key` & `name`)
 ** a Confluence Space (name based on project's `key`)
 ** the required Openshift projects named `key`-dev, `key`-test and `key`-cd - in case `openshiftproject == true`. Internally this is done thru a rest call to rundeck triggering the https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-project-quickstarters/blob/master/rundeck-jobs/openshift/create-projects.yaml[create-projects rundeck job]
 ** a Bitbucket Project (name based on project `key`) - in case `openshiftproject == true`. Within this project two default repositories are created `key`-oc-config-artifacts for all `yaml` resources as well as `key`-design for any design artifacts (e.g. sketches)
. A normal user (user in a group defined in property `idmanager.group.opendevstack-users`) creates all resources required for a working component -
this happens thru the user interface - in going to modify project / picking your project and then the wanted quickstarter. Internally this is done thru a rest call to rundeck - with the picked job as parameter - https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-project-quickstarters/tree/master/rundeck-jobs/quickstarts[here]
 ** Bitbucket repository within the chosen project named `key`-`boilerplate name`
 ** Openshift components based on the chosen boilerplate, coming from https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-project-quickstarters[ods-quickstarters]
. The involved people receive an email with the setup, URLs to components etc. - in case `mail.enabled == true`

== Integration with Bitbucket (webhooks)

Next to the provision app creating the bitbucket repository for a chosen quickstarter - it also creates a webhook on that repo, which triggers on three events

----
    List<String> events = new ArrayList<String>();
        events.add("repo:refs_changed");
        events.add("pr:merged");
        events.add("pr:declined");
    webhook.setEvents(events);
----

This webhook calls the https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-core/tree/master/jenkins/webhook-proxy[webhook proxy] which in turn creates an openshift `build config` of type `pipeline` in the `name`-cd project and executes it.

== Permissions

By default no special permissions are set on either confluence / jira / bitbucket or openshift, only system-wide settings are inherited.

However there is a special knob to tighten security (which can be passed with the project input `createpermissionset : boolean`)  - based on three groups that need to be provided as part of the API call / from the userinterface.

. admin group: admin rights on the generated projects / spaces / repositories
. user group: read / write rights on the generated projects / spaces / repositories
. readonly group: read rights on the generated projects / spaces / repositories

The configuration for the permission sets are configured:

. JIRA Project is provisioned with its own permissionset defined in https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-provisioning-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/permission-templates/jira.permission.all.txt[src/main/resources/permission-templates/jira.permission.all.txt]
. Confluence Project is provisioned with special permission set defined in https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-provisioning-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/permission-templates[src/main/resources/permission-templates/confluence.permission.*]
. Bitbucket Project is provisioned with tight read & write roles
. Openshift Project roles linked to the passed groups (`READONLY` - `view`, `ADMINGROUP` - `admin`, `USERS` - `edit`)

== Project/Space types based on templates

The default jira / confluence project' types are defined in https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-provisioning-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties[src/main/resources/application.properties] - and correspondingly in the config maps

----
project.template.key.names=default

jira.project.template.key=com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-scrum-template
jira.project.template.type=software

confluence.blueprint.key=com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-software-project:sp-space-blueprint
----

To add a new template - copy, and add your config, based on a new `<name>`

----
jira.project.template.key.<name>=com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-scrum-template
jira.project.template.type.<name>=software

# optional, can stay as is
confluence.blueprint.key.<name>=com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-software-project:sp-space-blueprint
----

and add the new +++<name>+++from above to the existing property `project.template.key.names`+++</name>+++

----
# list of templates surfaced to the UI and API
project.template.key.names=default,<name>
----

== Using the provision application via API / thru direct REST calls

[source,bash]
----
PROVISION_API_HOST=<host name>

curl -D headers.txt -k -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-X POST ${PROVISION_API_HOST}/j_security_check \
-d username=<username> -d password=<password>

# grab the login status, and exit if error
login_status=$(cat headers.txt | grep ${PROVISION_API_HOST}/login?error)

if [[ $login_status != "" ]]; then echo "Login Error"; exit 1; fi;

# grab the needed IDs and bake the cookies
JSESSION_ID=$(cat headers.txt | grep "Set-Cookie: JSESSION" | cut -d ';' -f1 | cut -d ":" -f2)";"
CROWD_COOKIE=$(cat headers.txt | grep "Set-Cookie: crowd" | cut -d ';' -f1 | cut -d ":" -f2)

COOKIES=${JSESSION_ID}${CROWD_COOKIE}

# sample provision file >> create.txt
{
  "name" : "<Mandatory name>",
  "key" : "<Mandatory key>",
  "createpermissionset" : true,
  "jiraconfluencespace" : true,
  "admin" : "<admin user>",
  "adminGroup" : "<admin group>",
  "userGroup" : "<user group>",
  "readonlyGroup" : "<readonly group>",
  "openshiftproject" : false
}

provisionfile=create.txt

# invoke the provision API to create a new project
curl -k -X POST --cookie "$COOKIES" -d @"$provisionfile" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -v ${PROVISION_API_HOST}/api/v2/project
----


== What happens in error cases

Up to (and including) _v1.1.x_ when provisioning failed, corrupt and inconsistent states where left in the bugtracker system, bitbucket etc. which had do be cleaned up _manually_ based on logs. This is rectified and a the new `default` behavior is to see every post to the API as `atomic` unit of work, which in case of failure is tried to be cleaned up (alike functional rollback). This behavior can be turned _off_ by specifying the new property
_provision.cleanup.incomplete.projects_ and setting it to _false_.
