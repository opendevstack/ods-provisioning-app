## Introduction
This application creates new OpenDevStack projects. It is the central entrypoint to get started with a new project / or provision new components based on [quickstarters](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-quickstarters).
It delegates the tasks to create / update resources to several services such as Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket and Jenkins.

## Documentation

The sources are located in the antora folder at https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-provisioning-app/tree/master/docs/.

## Development

Open the cloned provision application in your favorite IDE.

If you run the application locally, you will have to provide some addional information.

In case you want to use a local Nexus, you will have to create a `gradle.properties` file in the root to provide the Nexus credentials.
```
nexus_url=http://nexus-cd.192.168.56.101.nip.io
nexus_user=developer
nexus_pw=developer
```

You also have to ensure the Nexus certificate is integrated in the keystore of the JDK the IDE uses.

If you donâ€™t want to use the internal Nexus, you will have to provide a `gradle.properties` file with the following content:
```
no_nexus=true
```

After startup the application is available at http://localhost:8080/.

You can login in with the Crowd admin user.
