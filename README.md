## Introduction
This application creates new OpenDevStack digital projects. It is the central entrypoint to get started with a new project / or provision new components based on [quickstarters](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-project-quickstarters).
It delegates the tasks to create / update resources to several services such as jira, confluence, bitbucket and jenkins - which are the default implementations
